JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT

{} => GLOBAL EXECUTION => `this` Keyword referes this.

There are several Types of JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXTs:-

Mainly: 1. GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT
        2. FUNCTION EXECUTION CONTEXT

OPTIONAL: 3. EVAL EXECUTION CONTEXT


Phases of JAVASCRIPT file EXECUTION:-
1. GLOBAL EXECUTION
2. {} => Memory *Creation Phase* (Memory allocation)
3. EXECUTION Phase (all the operations +-*/)

Example code:-

let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5

function addNum(num1,num2){
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total
}

let result1 = addnum(val1,val2)
let result1 = addnum(10,5)


Total execution phase of this code:-
* Global Execution
2. Memory phase =>

    a. val1  = undefined
    b. val2 = undefined
    c. addNum = defination
    d. result1 = undefined
    e. result2 = undefined

3. Execution Phase =>

    a. val1 = 10
    b. val2 = 8
    c. addNum = new execution context =>
                    1. new variable environment
                    2. Execution thread

                Memory phase=>
                a. val1 = undefined
                b. val2 = undefined
                c. total = undefined

                Execution phase =>

                a. num1 = 10
                b. num2 = 8
                c. total = (10+8) = 18 [Returned to Global execution]


3. Execution Phase (for second function call)=>

    a. 10
    b. 8
    c. addNum = new execution context =>
                    1. new variable environment
                    2. Execution thread

                Memory phase=>
                a. val1 = undefined
                b. val2 = undefined
                c. total = undefined

                Execution phase =>

                a. num1 = 10
                b. num2 = 8
                c. total = (10+8) = 18 [Returned to Global execution]
